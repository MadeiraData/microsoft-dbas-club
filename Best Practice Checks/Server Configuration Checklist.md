**Server Configuration Checklist**

- **CPU** :
  - How many logical cpus?
  - Check in the task manager  performance  CPU for sockets , cores, hyper-threading (virtalization enabled)
  - Logical or physical server
  - In the instance properties – make sure CPU affinity is NOT checked
- **Memory** :
  - How much memory does the server have?
  - In the instance properties - check max server memory (right click on instance for properties)– should not be higher than the recommended value calculated by this script:

  - Minimum server memory – if sql server is the only thing running on the server maybe you should configure this to reduces cases when an external process takes memory from sql server.
- **Instance Configurations (right click instance**  **** **properties):**
  - Change SA user&#39;s name and disable it.
  - Allow remote connections is checked
  - Auditing should be only for failed logins unless there is a good reason so the log won&#39;t blow with unneeded messages.
  - Authentication mode – know what it is configured to. Best practice is windows.
  - Check if default fill factor is not 0 – make a note if it is different.
  - Check compress backup is checked.
  - Recovery interval should be 0. Otherwise affects the checkpoint timing.
  - File default locations should be changed to the proper locations.
  - Advanced tab for the instance:
    - Optimize for ad-hoc workloads – should be checked for workloads that have a lot of ad-hoc queries. When turned on, once used plans are not taking up space in the cache.
    - Network packet size – usually the app decides on connection, here it is more for linked servers. Best for bulk insert. Bigger packet size is cutting the data to less chunks.
    - Cost threshold for parallelism – when queries cost is over this threshold parallelism will be considered. Best practice start at 50 for OLTP workload and check from there.
    - Max degree of parallelism – how many threads parallelism will use – we don&#39;t want one query to take it all and there is a managing overhead. Best practice is 8. For new versions can be configured at the database level.
    - **These options could clear the plan cache!**
- **Database level configurations** :
  - Database owner should be SA (even if disabled).
  - Files:
    - Initial size – File size should be big enough for the future but not too big so it requires too much storage.
    - Autogrowth – should not be percent and should grow by a reasonable amount (not too much not too little)
  - Recovery model – if FULL requires log backups. When in SIMPLE data can be lost up to the last full backup.
  - Autoshrink should be off
  - Autoclose should be off
  - Auto update statistics can be disabled (clears plan cache) and we can run it as a job
  - Cardinality estimator – make note which estimator is being used.
  - Compatibility level – make note which one is being used.
  - Parameter sniffing should be on
- **Instant file initialization** – when new storage needs to be given to a file the operating system will zero it out first (initialize). If is set ON there are will be no initializing with zeros which is faster. Under Security users give instant file initialization permission to the user that is running SQLServer. If creating a large file is fast then instant file initialization is ON.
- **Tempdb** :
  - 4 data files or 8 with the exact same size and same autogrowth. More files will remediate contention on IAM, SGAM page when creating temp objects.
  - 1117,1118 trace flags (requires restart) turned ON.
  - Check collation is the same with other databases and instance. Otherwise collation changes must be made when using temp objects.
- **Service level (Configuration Manager):**
  - SQL Server and Agent service user – should not be a local system account because it allows access to all disks. Agent and Engine services should have different users.
  - For security - change default port as well.
- **Maintenance:**
  - Avoid running shrink on files regularly.
- **Tools:**
  - Configuration Manager
  - Task Manager
  - Sql query Stress test – simulates stress on databases. Can be used to check tempdb contention (if there are current waiting tasks on pages with database\_id = 2).
  - Snippets:
    - Show current running queries
    - Waiting tasks
